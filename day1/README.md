📝 What I Learned
Using the print() function to display output
Debugging simple syntax errors
String manipulation (concatenation & newline characters)
Using input() to take user input

The final project for Day 1 was a Band Name Generator, where the user is asked for their city and pet’s name to generate a band name.
